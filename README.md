# Relative Dates Alfred Workflow #

Generate relative dates based on a simple input format and your own date formatting parameters (there are some default placeholders you can delete).

Supports multiple locales/languages.

## Keywords ##

- `date` — Generate a formatted date using the [input format](#input-format)
	+ `↩` — Copy date to clipboard
	+ `⌘+↩` — Copy date to clipboard and paste into frontmost app
- `datehelp` — Open (this) help file
- `dateformats` — View saved date formats
	+ `⌘+↩` — Delete date format
- `dateadd` — Add a new date format
	+ `↩` — Save the date format
- `datereset` — Reset the saved date formats to the defaults


## Input format ##

`(+/-)<NUM>(w|d|y)` where `w` = week(s), `d` = day(s) and `y` = year(s)

You needn't specify a sign: `+` is understood as the default, so `+1d` and `1d` mean the same thing.

Months are not supported, as it leads to ambiguity: what if today is the 31st, but the target month only has 30 days? Similarly, a year is naively defined as 365 days.

### Examples ###

- `0` = `now` = `today` — today's date
- `1d` — 1 day from now
- `7d` = `1w` — 1 week from now
- `-21d` = `-3w` — 3 weeks ago


## Supported formats ##

The Workflow includes a few defaults for the locales `en_US`, `en_GB` and `de_DE`.

You can specify your own custom date formats using the following symbols, and you can also specify a language (locale) with the format `lang=de` or `lang=de_DE` if you want to use dates formatted for a language different to your system's.
